Event Planner Web Application (MERN)

This project is a modern and responsive Event Planner Web Application built using the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. The goal of the platform is to make event planning easier by helping users find the right vendors for any type of event, whether it is a wedding, birthday party, corporate event, or any other special occasion. The site organizes all services into clear categories such as Catering, Photography, Halls, Makeup, Decoration, and more. Users can browse these categories, explore available vendors, and select the ones that best match their needs.

Each vendor has a dedicated page that displays important details including ratings, package information, galleries, descriptions, and contact details. This helps users compare vendors and make better decisions. The system also allows users to book multiple vendors for a single event, making the entire planning process simple and efficient. The user interface is designed to be elegant and fully responsive, ensuring smooth performance across mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.

The frontend is developed with React and structured with reusable components, clean code, and modern UI practices. The backend uses Node.js and Express.js to manage vendor data, bookings, categories, and user-related operations. MongoDB handles the database storage, allowing the application to scale as the number of vendors and users grows. The project follows a simple and clear folder structure for both the client and server, making it easy to understand and work with.

In the future, the project can be expanded with features such as an admin dashboard for vendor and booking management, online payment options, user reviews, favorites, live chat, and vendor subscription systems. These additions can enhance functionality and make the application a complete event planning solution. The project is open to improvements and contributions from anyone interested in extending its features or refining the user experience.
